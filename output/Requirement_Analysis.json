### Explanation and Advice for Implementation

1. **Project Overview**: This section provides a brief introduction to the project, including its name, description, and objective. It serves as a quick reference for understanding the project's purpose.

2. **Functional Requirements**: Detailed specifications of what the app must do. Each feature/component has its description and list of requirements. For example, the "User Interface" feature includes requirements for displaying a button to generate a random number and showing the generated number.

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**: These define how the system should behave, focusing on performance, security, and usability. For instance, the app should generate a random number quickly and ensure the number is secure and unpredictable.

4. **Technical Constraints**: This section outlines limitations and considerations for the development process, such as the platforms the app should support and any external dependencies required.

5. **API Specifications**: If the app integrates with external services or provides an API for other applications, this section details the endpoints, methods, parameters, and response formats. For the random number app, an API could be used to generate numbers, allowing for integration with other applications.

6. **Data Models**: Definitions of the data structures used by the app. For the random number app, a simple data model might include the generated number and the range from which it was generated.

### Next Steps for the Coding Team

- Review the structured requirements to ensure understanding of the project's scope and specifications.
- Begin designing the architecture of the app, considering the technical constraints and non-functional requirements.
- Develop the user interface and core functionality (random number generation) first, ensuring to meet the performance and security requirements.
- Implement settings and any additional features as outlined in the functional requirements.
- Test the app thoroughly against all specified requirements to ensure compliance and quality.
- Consider iterative development and feedback loops to refine the app based on user feedback and testing results.
