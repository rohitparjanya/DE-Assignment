**Deployment Configuration for To-Do List Application**

To ensure scalability, security, and efficiency, we will use a containerized approach with Docker and Kubernetes. We will also set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.

### Recommended Deployment Strategies

1. **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize the application, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.
2. **Orchestration**: Use Kubernetes to manage and orchestrate the containers, providing scalability, high availability, and self-healing capabilities.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Use Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.
4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform to manage and provision infrastructure resources, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup and Tools

1. **Jenkins**: Use Jenkins as the CI/CD pipeline tool to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
2. **Docker**: Use Docker to containerize the application and ensure consistency across different environments.
3. **Kubernetes**: Use Kubernetes to manage and orchestrate the containers, providing scalability and high availability.
4. **Terraform**: Use Terraform to manage and provision infrastructure resources, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Configurations

We will use Terraform to manage and provision infrastructure resources. The following is an example Terraform configuration file:
```terraform
# Configure the AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "todo_list_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

# Create a subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "todo_list_subnet" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.todo_list_vpc.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
}

# Create a security group
resource "aws_security_group" "todo_list_sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.todo_list_vpc.id
  name        = "todo_list_sg"
  description = "Security group for todo list application"

  # Allow inbound traffic on port 80
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "todo_list_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c71c99"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.todo_list_sg.id]
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.todo_list_subnet.id
}
```
### Monitoring and Logging Practices

1. **Logging**: Use a logging framework like Log4j or Logback to log application events and errors.
2. **Monitoring**: Use a monitoring tool like Prometheus or Grafana to monitor application performance and metrics.
3. **Alerting**: Use an alerting tool like PagerDuty or Alertmanager to alert teams of application issues or errors.

### Deployment Configuration File

We will use a Docker Compose file to define the deployment configuration. The following is an example Docker Compose file:
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  todo_list:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=postgres

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```
This Docker Compose file defines two services: `todo_list` and `db`. The `todo_list` service builds the application from the current directory and exposes port 80. The `db` service uses the official Postgres image and mounts a volume to persist data.

### Kubernetes Deployment Configuration File

We will use a Kubernetes Deployment configuration file to define the deployment configuration. The following is an example Kubernetes Deployment configuration file:
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: todo-list
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: todo-list
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: todo-list
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: todo-list
        image: <image-name>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
This Kubernetes Deployment configuration file defines a deployment named `todo-list` with 3 replicas. The deployment uses a container with the specified image and exposes port 80.

### Jenkinsfile

We will use a Jenkinsfile to define the CI/CD pipeline. The following is an example Jenkinsfile:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t todo-list .'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -t todo-list python -m unittest discover -s tests'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This Jenkinsfile defines a pipeline with three stages: `Build`, `Test`, and `Deploy`. The `Build` stage builds the Docker image using the `docker build` command. The `Test` stage runs the unit tests using the `docker run` command. The `Deploy` stage deploys the application to Kubernetes using the `kubectl apply` command.

Note: This is a basic example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to create a `deployment.yaml` file that defines the Kubernetes deployment configuration.
